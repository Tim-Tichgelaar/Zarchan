Listing 2.1 represents a basic runge kutta simulation of a pure pro-nav missile with perfect information.
The simulation integrates the proportional navigation equation and target position to see how the missile interact with target maneuvers.

The parameters are labeled within and can be changed by adjusting the data at the beggining of the script.

Some editions have been made but eh script closely follows the original listing.
