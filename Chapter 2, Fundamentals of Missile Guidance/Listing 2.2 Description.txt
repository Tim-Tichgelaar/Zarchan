Listing 2.2 is the linearized version of listing 2.1.

It takes the nonlinear simulation and makes simplifications such as small angle approximations and parameterizes the engagement with vertical separation.
This take is numerically more efficient but more importantly allows for later tricks using adjoint theory.

The accompanying script takes this code and compares the linearized graph to the nonlinear one as in Figure 2.7
