Listing 1.1 is a sample Runge-Kutta second order integration; the python script has both the original and some related functions to graph both the results and thier errors.
The listing is designed to explore the accuracy of the runge kutta method and how it tends to generate error

The Integrator Functions take the arguments (W,T,Tf,Sc,Y,YD,X,H), where
					       W = Omega, the angular rate of the function
					       T = The starting time
					       Tf= The simulation stop time
					       Sc= The data recording timestep, a new point is written every Sc seconds
					       Y = initial Y value
					       YD= initial slope
					       X = X value from equation
					       H = Timestep

The Error and Plotting Functions take only (H1, H2, H3), the integration timesteps comparing between Euler and Runge Kutta integrations

As it is listed, a simple error comparison graph is set up
