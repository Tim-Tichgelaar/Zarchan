# Zarchan
Python scripts relating to Zarchan's "Tactical and Strategic Missile Guidance" Third edition

These Python scripts follow closely with the FORTRAN listings and figures in the book, at this time some have little commentary and follow the same opaque structure as the originals, while others have included efforts to make them more friendly to an outsider. The descriptions will list relevant parameters and a description of the ideas explored by the simulation.
